# Dataproject

This project examine the long-term unemployment in Denmark. It looks into different age-groups and different durations of unemployment and their development over time. I recommend running the code in the notebook as it produces the best and clear results with the combination of describtive text and code with a few comments. The code runs also in VScode but doesn't show the graphs, which are very essential in this project.

Enjoy!
