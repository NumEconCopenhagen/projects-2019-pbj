# Dataproject

This project examine the long-term unemployment in Denmark. It looks into different age-groups and different durations of unemployment and their development over time. 

The folder consists of a more or less identical notebook and python-file. I recommend running the code in the notebook as it produces the best and clear results with the combination of descriptive text and code with a few comments. The code also runs in VScode but doesn't show the graphs which are very essential in this project.

Enjoy!
