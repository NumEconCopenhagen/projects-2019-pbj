# Exam Project

The notebook contains problems and solutions to these problems. It is structured as follows: 
Each problem (model description and questions) is left unchanged in the beginning of the section. After that the first question is repeated and followed by a **method**-description in words on how the question is solved. The next cell is the code with comments. After the code the **Answer**-cell contains comments on the results found to the question. This is repeated for each question.

Some general notes:
- The most simple functions are assumed to be so obvious that a docstring isn't needed. More complicated functions get a docstring.
- Some of the code e.g. on plots is commented heavily in the beginning of the notebook whereas this is implicit later in the notebook as it is mostly the same actions.

The **results** of the project can be seen from running examproject.ipynb.

**Dependencies:** Apart from a standard Anaconda Python 3 installation the project requires no further installations.

Enjoy!
