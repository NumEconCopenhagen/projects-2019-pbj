# Modelproject

This project examines the basic Principal-Agent model known from game theory. The model is introduced and solved by sympy. Furthermore the results are presented in graphs using different values for the parameters.

The model is extended with a risk-averse agent which affects the outcome of the model. The two versions of the model are compared in graphs. A part of the comparison uses the sympy.ask-functions, but this part doesn't work properly yet. Feel free to ignore these few lines of code, but it would be very cool if you have any ideas to fix the bug.

Enjoy!
