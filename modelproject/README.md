# Modelproject

This project examines the basic Principal-Agent model known from game theory. The model is introduced and solved by sympy following an algorithm. Furthermore the results are presented in graphs using different values for the parameters.

The model is extended with a risk-averse agent which affects the outcome of the model. The two versions of the model are compared in graphs. A part of the comparison uses the sympy.ask-functions, but this part doesn't work properly yet. Feel free to ignore these few lines of code, but it would be very cool if you have any ideas to fix the bug.

Be aware that when running cells with sympy-output you may experience a pop-up window saying something like "Would you allow the app to make changes on your computer (MikTeX Package Manager)". It seems like the code runs regardless of your answer to this.

Enjoy!
