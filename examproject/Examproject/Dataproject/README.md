# Data Analysis Project

This project examines the long-term unemployment in Denmark. It looks into different age-groups and durations of unemployment and their development over time. Furthermore the analysis is extended with the share of long-term unemployed by gender. The notebook uses an API to get some of the data directly in the notebook and the rest of the data is downloaded from https://statistikbanken.dk/aulk09. The downloaded dataset also appears in the /Dataproject-folder.

The **results** of the project can be seen from running dataproject.ipynb.

**Dependencies:** Apart from a standard Anaconda Python 3 installation the project requires the following installations:

``pip install pandas-datareader``
``pip install git+https://github.com/elben10/pydst``

Enjoy!
